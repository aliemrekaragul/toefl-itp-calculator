                <div class="faq-question">What are the sections in the TOEFL ITP test?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>The test consists of three sections: Listening, Structure and Written Expression, and Reading.</p>
                    <p>All questions are in multiple-choice format, with four answer choices per question.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Listening Comprehension has 50 questions and measures the ability to understand spoken English as it is used in colleges and universities.</li>
                            <li>Structure and Written Expression has 40 questions and measures recognition of selected structural and grammatical points in standard written English </li>                       
                            <li>Reading Comprehension has 50 questions measures the ability to read and understand academic reading material written in English</p></li>

                <div class="faq-question">How are my scores calculated?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Your score will always depend on the test you take. Each test session has different questions. So, calculating a score by just counting the correct answers would include a lot of error in score calculation. That's why a scaling procedure is applied after each test depending on the difficulty of the test you take. </p>
                    <p>For example, if you take a test that is considered harder than an average test, you will get a higher score for the same number of correct answers compared to an easier test. </p>
                    <p>Although scoring approach is known, the weightings for a correct answer is calculated after the test is applied. So we could never know exactly what your score would be even if we knew the number of correct answers before an exam.</p>

                <div class="faq-question">What is the Test of English as a Foreign Language - Institutional Testing Pogram (TOEFL ITP)? What is the difference between TOEFL ITP and TOEFL IBT?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>TOEFL ITP  is a version of the TOEFL test designed primarily for internal use by educational institutions and organizations. It assesses the English language proficiency of non-native speakers in an academic context. TOEFL ITP is typically administered in a paper-based format.</p>
                    <p>The ITP version is often used for purposes such as placement testing, monitoring language proficiency over time, or as a requirement for certain programs that don't require the official TOEFL iBT.</p>
                    <p>It is usually offered at institutions and may not be as widely available as the TOEFL iBT.</p>
                    <p>The main differences between TOEFL ITP and TOEFL iBT are:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>TOEFL ITP is paper-based, while TOEFL iBT is internet-based.</li>
                        <li>TOEFL ITP is used for internal purposes, while TOEFL iBT is used for admission to colleges and universities.</li>
                        <li>TOEFL ITP is not accepted by all institutions that require TOEFL iBT scores.</li>
                        <li>TOEFL ITP may not include a speaking and a writing section while TOEFL IBT has listening, speaking, reading, and writing sections.</li>
                        <li>The TOEFL ITP uses scaled scores for each section and a total score. Each test application has its own scoring formula depending on the mean and standard deviation of the test session.</li>
                        <strong>In other words, you might get a different total score even if your number of correct answers are the same in different test sessions.</strong>
