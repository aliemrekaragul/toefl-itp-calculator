                        The test consists of three sections: Listening, Structure and
                        Written Expression, and Reading.

                        Your score will always depend on the test you take. Each test
                        session has different questions. So, calculating a score by just
                        counting the correct answers would include a lot of error in score
                        calculation. That's why a scaling procedure is applied after each
                        test depending on the difficulty of the test you take.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For example, if you take a test that is considered harder than an
                        average test, you will get a higher score for the same number of
                        correct answers compared to an easier test.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Although scoring approach is known, the weightings for a correct
                        answer is calculated after the test is applied. So we could never
                        know exactly what your score would be even if we knew the number
                        of correct answers before an exam.

                    <p>
                        TOEFL ITP is a version of the TOEFL test designed primarily for
                        internal use by educational institutions and organizations. It
                        assesses the English language proficiency of non-native speakers
                        in an academic context. TOEFL ITP is typically administered in a
                        paper-based format.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The ITP version is often used for purposes such as placement
                        testing, monitoring language proficiency over time, or as a
                        requirement for certain programs that don't require the official
                        TOEFL iBT.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is usually offered at institutions and may not be as widely
                        available as the TOEFL iBT.
                    </p>
                    <p>The main differences between TOEFL ITP and TOEFL iBT are:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            TOEFL ITP is paper-based, while TOEFL iBT is internet-based.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            TOEFL ITP is used for internal purposes, while TOEFL iBT is used
                            for admission to colleges and universities.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            TOEFL ITP is not accepted by all institutions that require TOEFL
                            iBT scores.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            TOEFL ITP may not include a speaking and a writing section while
                            TOEFL IBT has listening, speaking, reading, and writing
                            sections.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The TOEFL ITP uses scaled scores for each section and a total
                            score. Each test application has its own scoring formula
                            depending on the mean and standard deviation of the test
                            session.

                        <li>
                            <strong>In other words, you might get a different total score even if
                                your number of correct answers are the same in different test
