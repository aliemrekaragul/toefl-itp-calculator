      <h2>Strategies for Reading Section</h2>

      <p>TOEFL Test: Reading Comprehension Section Overview</p>
      <p>
        This section includes 50 questions (sometimes more) and lasts for 55 minutes. You will read passages and answer
        two types of questions related to the content:
      </p>
      <p>
        These questions test your understanding of the information provided in the passages. You will encounter
        different question types, such as identifying the main idea, answering direct detail questions, and interpreting
        implied details.
      </p>
      <p>
        Vocabulary Questions:
        These questions focus on the meanings of words in the passages. To find the meanings, you can rely on the
        surrounding context, structural clues in the sentence, or breaking down the word into recognizable parts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here are some strategies for the reading section of TOEFL ITP.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Know the instructions beforehand:
          The TOEFL instructions are always the same, so familiarize yourself with them in advance to save time during
          the test.
        </li>

        <li>
          Skim the passages efficiently:
          Don’t spend too much time reading the entire passage thoroughly. Many students skim for the main idea or jump
          straight to the questions, referring to the passage as needed.
        </li>

        <li>
          Don’t stress about unfamiliar topics:
          Everything needed to answer the questions is contained within the passages themselves, so prior knowledge of
          the topic is unnecessary.
        </li>

        <li>
          Answer every question:
          Even if you’re unsure, make a guess—there’s no penalty for incorrect answers.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br />
    </div>
    <strong>Skills to Detect the Idea of the Passage</strong>
    <div class="prep-tip-header" onclick="toggleSection('skill-1')">
      <strong>Skill 1</strong> - ANSWER MAIN IDEA QUESTIONS CORRECTLY
    </div>
    <div id="skill-1" class="section-content">
      <ul>
        <li>
          Most TOEFL reading passages include a question about the main idea, often phrased as the topic, subject,
          title, primary idea, or main idea.
        </li>
        <li>
          The main idea can usually be found in the beginning of the passage, particularly in the topic sentence.
        </li>
        <li>
          For passages with one paragraph, focus on the first sentence to identify the main idea and confirm it with the
          rest of the paragraph.
        </li>
        <li>
          To answer the question correctly, evaluate the options and choose the one that best matches the topic
          identified in the passage.
        </li>
        <li>
          Practice recognizing topic sentences and aligning answer choices with the main idea for accuracy in the
          Reading section of the TOEFL test.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="prep-tip-header" onclick="toggleSection('skill-2')">
      <strong>Skill 2</strong> - RECOGNIZE THE ORGANIZATION OF IDEAS
    </div>
    <div id="skill-2" class="section-content">
      <ul>
        <li>
          In TOEFL reading comprehension, you may encounter questions about how the ideas in one paragraph relate to
          ideas in another.
        </li>
        <li>
          To answer these questions, identify the main ideas of each paragraph and examine how they connect or contrast
          with each other.
        </li>
        <li>
          For example, one paragraph might support, precede, outline, or refute the ideas presented in another
          paragraph.
        </li>
        <li>
          Practice reading passages carefully to understand the relationships between paragraphs and improve accuracy in
          identifying organizational patterns.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <strong>Skills to Answer Detail Questions</strong>
    <div class="prep-tip-header" onclick="toggleSection('skill-3')">
      <strong>Skill 3</strong> - ANSWER STATED DETAIL QUESTIONS CORRECTLY
    </div>
    <div id="skill-3" class="section-content">
      <ul>
        <li>
          Stated detail questions focus on specific pieces of information from the passage, rather than the passage as a
          whole.
        </li>
        <li>
          The correct answer often paraphrases the information from the passage, so it may not match the exact wording.
        </li>
        <li>
          Answers are typically found in order in the passage, meaning the first question corresponds to the beginning
          of the text, the next question to the middle, and so on.
        </li>
        <li>
          Carefully review each answer choice and eliminate options that introduce incorrect information or distort the
          meaning of the passage.
        </li>
        <li>
          Practice locating and understanding specific details in the passage to improve accuracy in this question type.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="prep-tip-header" onclick="toggleSection('skill-4')">
      <strong>Skill 4</strong> - FIND "UNSTATED" DETAILS
    </div>
    <div id="skill-4" class="section-content">
      <ul>
        <li>
          "Unstated" detail questions require identifying information that is not mentioned or not true in the passage.
        </li>
        <li>
          This question type often includes three true statements and one false statement. Your task is to find the
          false or unstated detail.
        </li>
        <li>
          Carefully review the passage and compare each answer choice to the information provided, eliminating those
          that are mentioned.
        </li>
        <li>
          Pay attention to key details and wording to identify discrepancies or missing information.
        </li>
        <li>
          Practice distinguishing between stated and unstated details to improve accuracy in this type of question.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="prep-tip-header" onclick="toggleSection('skill-5')">
      <strong>Skill 5</strong> - FIND PRONOUN REFERENTS
    </div>
    <div id="skill-5" class="section-content">
      <ul>
        <li>
          Pronoun referent questions ask you to identify the noun that a pronoun in the passage refers to.
        </li>
        <li>
          Look before the pronoun in the text to find the noun it refers to, as pronouns usually follow their
          antecedents.
        </li>
        <li>
          Consider the grammatical agreement of the pronoun, such as singular or plural, to narrow down possible
          referents.
        </li>
        <li>
          Replace the pronoun with each possible noun to check which option makes the most sense in the context.
        </li>
        <li>
          Practice analyzing pronouns and their antecedents to improve speed and accuracy in these questions.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <strong>Skills to Find Implied Answers</strong>
    <div class="prep-tip-header" onclick="toggleSection('skill-6')">

    </div>
    <div id="skill-6" class="section-content">
      <ul>
        <li>
          Implied detail questions require drawing conclusions from specific details provided in the passage.
        </li>
        <li>
          These questions often use keywords like "implied," "inferred," or "likely" to indicate that the answer is not
          directly stated.
        </li>
        <li>
          Do not make assumptions beyond the information in the passage; instead, base your answer on evidence provided
          in the text.
        </li>
        <li>
          Analyze the context and look for hints or clues to deduce the correct answer logically.
        </li>
        <li>
          Practice identifying implied meanings and conclusions to enhance your understanding of passages.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="prep-tip-header" onclick="toggleSection('skill-7')">
      <strong>Skill 7</strong> - ANSWER TRANSITION QUESTIONS CORRECTLY
    </div>
    <div id="skill-7" class="section-content">
      <ul>
        <li>
          Transition questions test your ability to understand how ideas flow between paragraphs in a passage.
        </li>
        <li>
          You may be asked to determine what is most likely discussed in the preceding paragraph or what will be
          discussed in the following paragraph.
        </li>
        <li>
          These questions require analyzing the context and identifying logical connections between ideas.
        </li>
        <li>
          A paragraph may conclude with an idea that is developed further in the next paragraph.
        </li>
        <li>
          Transition questions help assess your understanding of the organization and coherence of the text.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <strong>Skills to Answer Vocabulary Questions</strong>
    <div class="prep-tip-header" onclick="toggleSection('skill-8')">
      <strong>Skill 8</strong> - FIND DEFINITIONS FROM STRUCTURAL CLUES
    </div>
    <div id="skill-8" class="section-content">
      <ul>
        <li>
          Structural clues in a passage can help identify the meaning of unfamiliar words.
        </li>
        <li>
          Look for punctuation such as commas, dashes, or parentheses that may indicate a definition or clarification of
          the word.
        </li>
        <li>
          Words like "is," "means," or "refers to" often introduce a definition.
        </li>
        <li>
          Analyze the context of the sentence and surrounding sentences to infer the meaning.
        </li>
        <li>
          Recognizing these structural clues can enhance understanding and improve performance on vocabulary-related
          questions.
        </li>
      </ul>

    </div>
    <div id="skill-9" class="section-content">
      <ul>
        <li>
          Study the components of a word (prefix, root, and suffix) to determine its meaning.
        </li>
        <li>
          The prefix provides clues about direction, quantity, or negation.
        </li>
        <li>
          The root word carries the main meaning and can often stand alone.
        </li>
        <li>
          The suffix can indicate the word's function (noun, verb, adjective, etc.) or modify its meaning.
        </li>
        <li>
          Combining these parts helps decipher the meaning of unfamiliar words, even without prior knowledge of the
          word.

        <li>
          Look for clues in the sentence, such as related ideas, comparisons, or examples, to understand the word's
          meaning.
        </li>
        <li>
          Focus on the sentence where the word appears and the sentences immediately before and after it for additional
          context.
        </li>
        <li>
          Eliminate options that are clearly unrelated to the context provided in the passage.
        </li>
        <li>
          Pay attention to key phrases that indicate the word’s role or relation in the sentence, such as "means,"

        <li>
          Eliminate choices that are clearly unrelated or incorrect based on the context clues in the sentence.
