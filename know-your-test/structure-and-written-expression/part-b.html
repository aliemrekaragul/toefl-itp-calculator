      <h2>Strategies for Structure and Written Expression Part B</h2>

      <p>TOEFL Test: Written Expression Section (Questions 16–40)</p>
      <p>
        This part of the TOEFL evaluates your ability to identify errors in
        written English. Each question presents a sentence with four
        underlined parts, and you must identify which underlined part contains
        an error.
      </p>
      <p>
        Below are some strategies to help you handle the Written Expression
        questions in the TOEFL exam:

      <!-- square_ad -->
      <ul>
        <li>
          Start with the underlined words or phrases: Look closely at the
          options to identify the incorrect one.
        </li>

        <li>
          If no error is obvious, read the full sentence: Errors might arise
          from how the underlined part interacts with the rest of the
          sentence.
        </li>

        <li>
          Always answer every question: Even if you are unsure, guessing can
          only improve your chances since unanswered questions don’t earn
          points.
        </li>

        <li>
          Answer every question: Even if unsure, guessing can’t hurt since
          there’s no penalty for incorrect answers.

      <strong>Skill 1</strong> - MAKE VERBS AGREE AFTER PREPOSITIONAL PHRASES
    </div>
    <div id="skill-1" class="section-content">
      <ul>
        <li>
          Prepositional phrases can come between the subject and the verb,
          potentially causing confusion about subject-verb agreement.
        </li>
        <li>
          The subject of the sentence determines the verb agreement, not the
          object of the preposition (e.g., "The key
          <em>(to the doors)</em> is in the drawer").
        </li>
        <li>
          Be cautious when a singular subject is followed by a plural object
          of a preposition or vice versa, as this can mislead you into making
          errors.
        </li>
        <li>
          Practice identifying the true subject of the sentence to ensure
          proper subject-verb agreement, especially when prepositional phrases
          are present.

      <strong>Skill 2</strong> - MAKE VERBS AGREE AFTER EXPRESSIONS OF
      QUANTITY
    </div>
    <div id="skill-2" class="section-content">
      <ul>
        <li>
          Expressions of quantity, such as <em>all</em>, <em>most</em>, or
          <em>some</em>, can be singular or plural depending on the noun
          following the preposition <em>of</em>.
        </li>
        <li>
          For example, "All <em>(of the book)</em> was interesting" uses a
          singular verb because the noun <em>book</em> is singular, while "All
          <em>(of the books)</em> were interesting" uses a plural verb.
        </li>
        <li>
          When the noun is uncountable (e.g., "All
          <em>(of the information)</em> was interesting"), the verb is
          singular.
        </li>
        <li>
          Practice determining whether the noun after <em>of</em> is singular,
          plural, or uncountable to ensure proper subject-verb agreement in
          the Structure section of the TOEFL test.
        </li>

    </div>
    <div id="skill-3" class="section-content">
      <ul>
        <li>
          Subject-verb inversion occurs in certain cases, such as after
          question words, place expressions, negative expressions, omitted
          conditionals, and comparisons.
        </li>
        <li>
          When the subject comes after the verb, ensure the verb agrees with
          the subject and not with the preceding words or phrases (e.g.,
          "Behind the house <em>were</em> the bicycles I wanted").
        </li>
        <li>
          Be cautious when the subject follows the verb due to inversion
          caused by a place or prepositional expression (e.g., "Behind the
          houses <em>was</em> the bicycle I wanted").
        </li>
        <li>
          Practice identifying the true subject in inverted sentences to
          ensure proper agreement between the subject and verb, especially in
          formal or test contexts.

      <ul>
        <li>
          Certain words in English, such as <em>everybody</em> and
          <em>nobody</em>, are grammatically singular even if they imply
          multiple people or things.
        </li>
        <li>
          These words require a singular verb to maintain correct subject-verb
          agreement (e.g., "Everybody <em>is</em>
          going to the theater").
        </li>
        <li>
          Examples of these words include <em>anybody</em>, <em>someone</em>,

      <ul>
        <li>
          Coordinate conjunctions like <em>and</em>, <em>but</em>, or
          <em>or</em> join equal parts of a sentence, such as nouns, verbs,
          adjectives, phrases, or clauses.
        </li>
        <li>
          Ensure that the elements on both sides of the conjunction are
          parallel in structure (e.g., "I need to talk to the manager
          <em>or</em> the assistant manager").
        </li>
        <li>
          Parallel structure applies to lists of verbs (e.g., "He
          <em>eats</em> and <em>sleeps</em> on vacation"), adjectives (e.g.,
          "My boss is <em>sincere</em> and <em>nice</em>"), phrases, or entire
          clauses.
        </li>
        <li>
          Practice constructing sentences with consistent grammatical forms to

          Paired conjunctions like <em>both...and</em>, <em>either...or</em>,

          parallel structure.
        </li>
        <li>
          Ensure that the grammatical forms following each part of the paired
          conjunction are the same (e.g., "He wants
          <em>either to go by train or to go by plane</em>").
        </li>
        <li>
          Use the correct pairs together: <em>both</em> with <em>and</em>,
          <em>either</em> with <em>or</em>, and <em>neither</em> with
          <em>nor</em>, to maintain grammatical accuracy.
        </li>
        <li>
          Avoid mismatches in structure and pairing, and practice using paired

    </div>
    <div id="skill-8" class="section-content">
      <ul>
        <li>
          Comparatives are formed with <em>-er</em> or <em>more</em> and are
          followed by <em>than</em>. Use <em>-er</em> for short adjectives
          (e.g., "Bob is taller <em>than</em> Ron") and <em>more</em> for
          longer adjectives (e.g., "Sally is more beautiful
          <em>than</em> Sharon").
        </li>
        <li>
          Superlatives are formed with <em>-est</em> or <em>most</em>, often
          preceded by <em>the</em>. Use <em>-est</em> for short adjectives
          (e.g., "Bob is the tallest man in the room") and <em>most</em> for

          Comparatives are used to compare two equal things. They are often

        <li>
          Superlatives are used to compare three or more items to identify the

          <em>most</em>, often preceded by <em>the</em> (e.g., "The history
          class is the largest in the school").
        </li>
        <li>
          Be careful to match the comparative or superlative form with the
          type of adjective: use <em>-er</em> and <em>-est</em> for shorter
          adjectives and <em>more</em> and <em>most</em> for longer ones.

          Whenever you see the verb <em>have</em> in any of its forms (e.g.,
          <em>have</em>, <em>has</em>, <em>having</em>, <em>had</em>), ensure
          that the verb following it is in the past participle form.
        </li>
        <li>

        <li>
          For example, "The boat will <em>leaving</em> at 3:00" should be

        </li>
        <li>
          Be cautious not to use conjugated or participle forms after modals

        <li>
          Switching between the past tense and the present tense in a sentence
          is usually incorrect unless the meaning is logical.
        </li>
        <li>
          For example, "He <em>took</em> the money when he <em>wants</em> it"
          is incorrect because the past action cannot result from a present
          desire. It should be corrected to "He <em>took</em> the money when
          he <em>wanted</em> it."
        </li>
        <li>
          A sentence can logically combine past and present tense if the
          context makes sense (e.g., "I <em>know</em> that he
          <em>took</em> the money yesterday").
        </li>
        <li>
          Carefully analyze sentences to ensure that tense usage aligns with
          the intended meaning, especially when both past and present tense
          are used.
        </li>

    <div id="skill-15" class="section-content">
      <ul>
        <li>
          The present perfect tense (<em>have/has + past participle</em>)
          refers to a period of time from the past until the present (e.g.,
          "Sue <em>has lived</em> in Los Angeles for ten years").
        </li>
        <li>
          The past perfect tense (<em>had + past participle</em>) refers to an
          action that occurred in the past before another past event (e.g.,
          "Sue <em>had lived</em> in Los Angeles before she moved to San
          Diego").
        </li>
        <li>
          Avoid combining the present perfect with events that are clearly in
          the past (e.g., "At the start of the nineteenth century, Thomas
          Jefferson <em>has become</em> president" is incorrect; it should be
          "became").
        </li>
        <li>
          Similarly, avoid combining the past perfect with present actions
          (e.g., "Tom <em>had finished</em> the exam when the teacher
          <em>collects</em> the papers" is incorrect; it should be
          "collected").
        </li>

      <ul>

          Time expressions in a sentence often indicate which verb tense
          should be used. For example:
          <ul>
            <li>
              "We <em>moved</em> to New York in 1970" uses the simple past
              because of the specific past time mentioned.
            </li>
            <li>
              "We <em>had left</em> by 1980" uses the past perfect because the
              action occurred before another past time.
            </li>
            <li>
              "We <em>have lived</em> in San Francisco since 1982" uses the
              present perfect to indicate a continuous action up to the
              present.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Common time expressions include <em>ago</em>, <em>last</em>,
          <em>since</em>, and <em>lately</em>, each requiring specific tenses.
        </li>
        <li>
          Match the tense to the time expression for clarity and correctness
          (e.g., "She <em>got</em> a job two years ago" vs. "She
          <em>has worked</em> very hard lately").
        </li>
        <li>
          Practice analyzing sentences with time expressions to select the

    <div id="skill-17" class="section-content">
      <ul>
        <li>
          The simple present tense is paired with <em>will</em>, and the
          simple past tense is paired with <em>would</em> in English sentences
          to maintain logical consistency (e.g., "I <em>know</em> that they
          <em>will arrive</em> soon" vs. "I <em>knew</em> that they
          <em>would arrive</em>").
        </li>
        <li>
          Avoid mixing present tense with <em>would</em> or past tense with
          <em>will</em>, as these combinations are incorrect (e.g., "I
          <em>know</em> that they <em>would arrive</em>" is incorrect).
        </li>
        <li>
          Correct examples include "I <em>knew</em> that he

          <em>will graduate</em>."
        </li>
        <li>
          Note: The modal <em>would</em> can also be used in polite requests,

          if you have a pencil that I could borrow").

      <ul>
        <li>
          The passive voice is formed with a form of <em>be</em> + the past
          participle of the main verb (e.g., "The portrait
          <em>was painted</em> by a famous artist").
        </li>
        <li>
          Avoid errors such as using the present participle instead of the
          past participle (e.g., "The portrait <em>was painting</em>" is
          incorrect; it should be "<em>was painted</em>").
        </li>
        <li>
          Ensure that the verb <em>be</em> is included to form the passive
          correctly (e.g., "The project <em>will finished</em>" is incorrect;
          it should be "<em>will be finished</em>").

      <ul>
        <li>
          To determine if a sentence is active or passive, study whether the
          subject does the action (active) or receives the action (passive).
        </li>
        <li>
          Active voice examples: "We <em>mailed</em> the package at the post
          office."

        <li>
          Passive voice examples: "The letter <em>was mailed</em> by us today
          before noon."
        </li>
        <li>
          Look for clues such as the presence of <em>by</em> + object in
          passive sentences or the absence of an explicit object in active
          sentences.
        </li>
        <li>
          Be cautious with sentences where the verb appears to be active but
          the meaning requires a passive form (e.g., "The letter
          <em>mailed*</em> today before noon" should be "was mailed").
        </li>

          Practice recognizing active and passive structures to avoid errors
