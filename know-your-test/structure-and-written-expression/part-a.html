      <h2>General Tips For Structure and Written Expression Section</h2>
      <p>TOEFL Test Structure and Written Expression Section Overview:</p>
      <p>
        This part of the TOEFL test includes 40 questions (occasionally more)
        and is allocated 25 minutes for completion. It consists of two types
        of questions:
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong> Structure (Questions 1–15):</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        These questions require you to select the grammatically correct answer
        to complete a sentence with a missing part. Each sentence has four
        possible answer options.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong> Written Expression (Questions 16–40):</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        These questions ask you to identify errors in sentences. Four words or
        phrases are underlined in each question, and you must pick the
        incorrect one.
      </p>
      <p>
        Below are some strategies to help you handle the Structure and Written
        Expression questions in the TOEFL exam:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Understand the Instructions in Advance: Since the instructions are
          consistent across all TOEFL tests, familiarize yourself with them
          ahead of time. This saves time during the test.
        </li>
        <li>
          Start with Questions 1–15: The first five questions are likely the
          easiest, while questions 11–15 are more challenging. Avoid wasting
          too much time on the harder questions early on. Easier questions
          appear later in the test.
        </li>
        <li>
          Proceed to Questions 16–40: Questions 16–20 are generally simpler,
          but the difficulty increases toward questions 36–40. Allocate your
          time wisely to avoid getting stuck on the more difficult ones.
        </li>
        <li>
          Review Difficult Questions if Time Permits: Revisit harder questions
          (like those in 11–15) only after you’ve worked through all the
          easier ones.
        </li>
        <li>
          Always Answer Every Question: Guess if necessary. There's no penalty
          for incorrect answers, so leaving a question blank reduces your
          chances of scoring points.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Strategies for Structure and Written Expression Part A</h2>

      <p>TOEFL Test: Structure Questions Overview (Questions 1–15):</p>
      <p>
        These questions evaluate your understanding of proper English sentence
        structure. Each question is multiple-choice, and you need to select
        the answer that accurately completes the sentence.
      </p>
      <p>
        Below are some strategies to help you handle the Structure questions
        in the TOEFL exam:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Examine the sentence first: Focus on identifying what is missing to
          make the sentence grammatically correct.
        </li>

        <li>
          Evaluate how each answer fits the sentence: Reject options that fail
          to complete the sentence correctly.
        </li>

        <li>
          Don’t eliminate choices solely based on their correctness in
          isolation: Some incorrect answers may appear fine individually but
          fail when used in the context of the sentence.
        </li>

        <li>
          Answer every question: Even if unsure, guessing can’t hurt since
          there’s no penalty for incorrect answers.
        </li>
        <li>
          Manage your time wisely: Don’t linger on these questions too long,
          as you’ll need time for the Written Expression section.
        </li>
      </ul>

    <strong>Skills to Develop for Sentences with Only One Clause</strong>
    <div class="prep-tip-header" onclick="toggleSection('skill-1')">
      <strong>Skill 1</strong> - BE SURE THE SENTENCE HAS A SUBJECT AND A VERB
    </div>
    <div id="skill-1" class="section-content">
      <ul>
        <li>
          In the Structure section of the TOEFL test, ensure that every
          sentence has both a subject and a verb.
        </li>
        <li>
          Problems may arise when either the subject or the verb is missing,
          when an extra subject or verb is present, or when they do not agree.
        </li>
        <li>
          Pay attention to singular and plural forms, as well as proper
          subject-verb agreement to select the best answer.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="prep-tip-header" onclick="toggleSection('skill-2')">
      <strong>Skill 2</strong> - BE CAREFUL OF OBJECTS OF PREPOSITIONS
    </div>
    <div id="skill-2" class="section-content">
      <ul>
        <li>
          An object of a preposition is a noun or pronoun that follows a
          preposition (e.g., in, at, of, to, by) and forms a prepositional
          phrase.
        </li>
        <li>
          In the Structure section of the TOEFL test, objects of prepositions
          can be mistaken for subjects, leading to errors in identifying the
          correct sentence structure.
        </li>
        <li>
          Look carefully for both the subject and the verb in a sentence and
          ensure that the object of a preposition is not incorrectly
          identified as the subject.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    </div>
    <div id="skill-3" class="section-content">
      <ul>
        <li>
          An appositive is a noun that follows another noun and provides
          additional information about it. It has the same meaning as the noun
          it refers to.
        </li>
        <li>
          In the Structure section of the TOEFL test, appositives can cause
          confusion because they might be mistaken for the subject of a
          sentence.
        </li>
        <li>
          Be attentive to appositive phrases, often separated by commas, and
          ensure they are not misidentified as the sentence's subject.

    <div class="prep-tip-header" onclick="toggleSection('skill-4')">
      <strong>Skill 4</strong> - BE CAREFUL OF PRESENT PARTICIPLES
    </div>
    <div id="skill-4" class="section-content">
      <ul>
        <li>
          A present participle is the -ing form of a verb (e.g., talking,
          playing) and can function as either part of a verb or an adjective.
        </li>
        <li>
          It is part of the verb when it is accompanied by a form of the verb
          "be" (e.g., is talking).
        </li>
        <li>
          A present participle is an adjective when it is not preceded by any
          form of the verb "be" (e.g., The man talking to his friend has a
          beard).
        </li>
        <li>
          In the Structure section of the TOEFL test, present participles can
          cause confusion if mistaken for the main verb of a sentence.
        </li>
        <li>
          Look for a complete subject and verb to determine whether the
          present participle is functioning as part of the verb or as an
          adjective.
        </li>
        <li>
          Avoid assuming that the -ing form is the verb unless supported by
          the context of the sentence.
        </li>
        <li>
          Use context clues and sentence structure to identify whether the
          present participle modifies a noun or completes a verb phrase.

    </div>
    <div id="skill-5" class="section-content">
      <ul>
        <li>
          A past participle is the form of a verb that appears with "have" or
          "be" (e.g., purchased, written) and can function as part of a verb
          or as an adjective.
        </li>
        <li>
          It is part of the verb when accompanied by "have" or "be" (e.g., The
          family has purchased a television).
        </li>
        <li>
          It functions as an adjective when not preceded by any form of "have"
          or "be" (e.g., The poem written by Paul appeared in the magazine).
        </li>
        <li>
          In the Structure section of the TOEFL test, past participles can
          cause confusion if mistaken for the main verb or if incorrectly
          identified as an adjective.
        </li>
        <li>
          Look for auxiliary verbs (e.g., has, have, is, was) to confirm
          whether the past participle is part of the verb phrase.
        </li>
        <li>
          Be aware of irregular past participles, as their forms might not
          follow standard patterns (e.g., bought, written, spoken).
        </li>
        <li>
          Use sentence context to determine whether the past participle
          modifies a noun or completes a verb phrase, avoiding errors in
          identifying the sentence structure.

    <strong>Skills to Develop for Sentences with Multiple Clauses</strong>
    <div class="prep-tip-header" onclick="toggleSection('skill-6')">
      <strong>Skill 6</strong> - USE COORDINATE CONNECTORS CORRECTLY
    </div>
    <div id="skill-6" class="section-content">
      <ul>
        <li>
          When connecting two clauses in an English sentence, use coordinate
          connectors such as <em>and</em>, <em>but</em>, <em>or</em>,
          <em>so</em>, or <em>yet</em>.
        </li>
        <li>
          A comma (,) is often used before the connector to properly join the
          clauses (e.g., Tom is singing, and Paul is dancing).
        </li>
        <li>
          Coordinate connectors link two independent clauses that have equal
          importance in the sentence structure.
        </li>
        <li>
          Ensure that the sentence contains a subject and verb on both sides
          of the connector to form complete clauses.
        </li>
        <li>
          Avoid using words like <em>then</em>, <em>later</em>, or
          <em>next</em> as they are not coordinate connectors and cannot link
          two clauses.
        </li>
        <li>
          Identify the relationship between the clauses to select the most
          appropriate connector (e.g., use <em>but</em> for contrast,
          <em>so</em> for cause and effect).
        </li>
        <li>
          Practice with examples to familiarize yourself with the correct use
          of coordinate connectors in the Structure section of the TOEFL test.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="prep-tip-header" onclick="toggleSection('skill-7')">
      <strong>Skill 7</strong> - USE ADVERB TIME AND CAUSE CONNECTORS
      CORRECTLY
    </div>
    <div id="skill-7" class="section-content">
      <ul>
        <li>
          Sentences with adverb clauses use connectors like <em>before</em>,
          <em>after</em>, <em>because</em>, <em>since</em>, and
          <em>while</em> to link clauses.
        </li>
        <li>
          Adverb time connectors describe when something happens, while adverb
          cause connectors explain why something happens.
        </li>
        <li>
          When the adverb connector comes at the beginning of a sentence, a
          comma (,) separates the clauses (e.g., Before you leave, I will sign
          the check).
        </li>
        <li>
          When the adverb connector is in the middle of the sentence, no comma
          is needed (e.g., I will sign the check before you leave).
        </li>
        <li>
          Ensure that each clause has a subject and a verb when using adverb
          connectors, as incomplete clauses can cause errors.
        </li>
        <li>
          Choose the correct connector based on the relationship between the
          clauses: use time connectors for sequence and cause connectors for
          reasons.
        </li>
        <li>
          Practice recognizing and applying these connectors to correctly join
          two clauses in the Structure section of the TOEFL test.

      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="prep-tip-header" onclick="toggleSection('skill-8')">
      <strong>Skill 8</strong> - USE OTHER ADVERB CONNECTORS CORRECTLY
    </div>
    <div id="skill-8" class="section-content">
      <ul>
        <li>
          Adverb clauses can express ideas beyond time and cause, such as
          contrast, condition, manner, and place, using specific connectors.
        </li>
        <li>
          Condition connectors include <em>if</em>, <em>provided</em>,
          <em>unless</em>, and <em>in case</em> (e.g., You will get a good
          grade provided you study).
        </li>
        <li>
          Contrast connectors include <em>although</em>, <em>even though</em>,
          <em>while</em>, and <em>whereas</em>, which show opposing ideas.
        </li>
        <li>
          Manner connectors, such as <em>as</em> or <em>in that</em>, describe
          the way something happens or is done.
        </li>
        <li>
          Place connectors, such as <em>where</em> and <em>wherever</em>,
          indicate location or direction.
        </li>
        <li>
          When these connectors appear at the beginning of a sentence, use a
          comma (,) to separate the clauses. No comma is needed when the
          connector is in the middle of the sentence.
        </li>
        <li>
          Ensure each clause has a subject and verb to avoid errors in
          sentence structure when using adverb connectors.

    <strong>Skills to Develop for More Sentences with Multiple Clauses</strong>
    <div class="prep-tip-header" onclick="toggleSection('skill-9')">
      <strong>Skill 9</strong> - USE NOUN CLAUSE CONNECTORS CORRECTLY
    </div>
    <div id="skill-9" class="section-content">
      <ul>
        <li>
          A noun clause functions as a noun and can act as the subject, object
          of a verb, or object of a preposition in a sentence.
        </li>
        <li>
          Noun clause connectors include <em>what</em>, <em>where</em>,
          <em>when</em>, <em>why</em>, <em>how</em>, <em>who</em>,
          <em>whom</em>, and <em>that</em>.
        </li>
        <li>
          These connectors link the main clause to a noun clause, turning the
          second clause into a functional component of the sentence (e.g., I
          know when he will arrive).
        </li>
        <li>
          Noun clauses can be tricky to identify because they often serve as
          subjects or objects within a sentence rather than as standalone
          elements.
        </li>
        <li>
          When a noun clause is the subject of a sentence, it must still
          follow subject-verb agreement rules (e.g., What you did was wrong).
        </li>
        <li>
          Pay attention to sentences with two verbs, ensuring each has a
          subject, and use the correct noun clause connector to avoid errors.
        </li>
        <li>
          Practice recognizing how noun clause connectors are used to
          correctly link ideas and provide clarity in the Structure section of
          the TOEFL test.

    <div id="skill-10" class="section-content">
      <ul>
        <li>
          In some cases, a noun clause connector can serve both as the subject
          of the noun clause and as the connector joining two clauses.
        </li>
        <li>
          Common noun clause connectors/subjects include <em>what</em>,
          <em>who</em>, <em>whichever</em>, and <em>whoever</em>.
        </li>
        <li>
          For example, in the sentence "What he said is true," the word
          <em>what</em> functions as both the subject of the noun clause and
          the connector linking it to the rest of the sentence.
        </li>
        <li>
          Ensure that each verb in the sentence has a subject, and verify that
          the noun clause connector/subject is fulfilling this role.
        </li>
        <li>
          Avoid confusion by distinguishing between noun clause connectors
          that act as subjects and those that do not (e.g., "The story was on
          television made me angry" is incorrect because
          <em>the story</em> cannot be the subject twice).
        </li>
        <li>
          Practice identifying noun clause connectors/subjects and their roles
          within sentences to avoid errors in the Structure section of the
          TOEFL test.
        </li>
        <li>
          Use sentence context to determine whether a connector is also

        <li>
          Adjective clause connectors include <em>who</em>, <em>whom</em>,

          Choose the correct connector based on the noun it describes:
          <em>who</em> or <em>whom</em> for people, and <em>which</em> or
          <em>that</em> for things.
        </li>
        <li>
          Pay attention to sentence structure when joining two clauses, as
          missing or incorrect connectors can result in incomplete or
          ungrammatical sentences.
        </li>
        <li>
          Practice identifying and applying adjective clause connectors to

          An adjective clause connector can also function as the subject of
          the clause it introduces.
        </li>
        <li>
          Common adjective clause connector/subjects include <em>who</em>,
          <em>which</em>, and <em>that</em>, depending on whether the clause
          describes a person, thing, or both.
        </li>
        <li>
          For example, in the sentence "The glass
          <em>that is on the table</em> contains milk," the word
          <em>that</em> functions as both the connector and the subject of the
          adjective clause.
        </li>
        <li>
          Ensure that the clause has a verb and that the connector/subject is
          properly linked to the noun it describes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Use <em>who</em> or <em>that</em> for people, and <em>which</em> or

        </li>
        <li>
          Avoid errors by ensuring that the connector/subject directly follows

    </div>
    <div id="skill-13" class="section-content">
      <ul>
        <li>
          Adjective clauses can often be reduced by omitting the connector
          (e.g., <em>who</em>, <em>which</em>, <em>that</em>) and the verb
          <em>be</em>, or by changing the verb to its <em>-ing</em> form.
        </li>
        <li>
          For example, "The woman <em>who is waiting</em> is our tour guide"
          can be reduced to "The woman <em>waiting</em> is our tour guide."
        </li>
        <li>
          Reduction is possible only if the adjective clause connector is
          directly followed by a verb or if there is no verb in the clause.
        </li>
        <li>
          When reducing clauses set off by commas, ensure that the modified
          noun is clear and that the clause remains grammatically correct.
        </li>
        <li>
          Reduced adjective clauses are often used for conciseness and clarity
          in writing and speaking.
        </li>
        <li>
          Be careful not to reduce adjective clauses incorrectly, such as when
          the connector is needed for meaning or clarity.
        </li>
        <li>
          Practice identifying when and how to reduce adjective clauses in the
          Structure section of the TOEFL test for better efficiency and
          accuracy.

    <div id="skill-14" class="section-content">
      <ul>
        <li>
          Adverb clauses can often be reduced by omitting the subject and verb
          <em>be</em> or by changing the verb to its <em>-ing</em> form.
        </li>
        <li>
          For example, "Although <em>she feels rather sick</em>, the speaker
          will take part in the seminar" can be reduced to "Although
          <em>feeling rather sick</em>, the speaker will take part in the
          seminar."
        </li>
        <li>
          When there is no verb in the adverb clause, the subject is omitted,
          and the main verb is changed to its <em>-ing</em> form (e.g., "While
          <em>you grow</em>, your speech will gain distinction" becomes "While
          <em>growing</em>, your speech will gain distinction").
        </li>
        <li>
          Reduction is only possible if the adverb clause is clear without the
          omitted subject and verb and remains grammatically correct.
        </li>
        <li>
          Be cautious not to reduce clauses incorrectly, such as when omitting
          essential elements that contribute to clarity or meaning.
        </li>
        <li>
          Reduced adverb clauses add conciseness and fluency to sentences but
          must retain the intended meaning of the original clause.
        </li>
        <li>
          Practice recognizing and applying adverb clause reductions in the

        <li>
          Question words such as <em>what</em>, <em>when</em>, <em>where</em>,
          <em>why</em>, and <em>how</em> can serve two functions: introducing
          a question or connecting two clauses.
        </li>
        <li>
          When introducing a question, the subject and verb are inverted
          (e.g., "What is the homework?" or "Where are you going?").
        </li>
        <li>
          When connecting two clauses, the subject and verb following the
          question word are not inverted (e.g., "I do not know
          <em>what the homework is</em>" or "Do you know
          <em>where you are going</em>?").
        </li>
        <li>
          Be attentive to whether the question word is part of a direct
          question or a connecting phrase, as this determines the sentence
          structure.
        </li>
        <li>
          Incorrectly inverting the subject and verb in a clause connected by
          a question word can lead to grammatical errors.
        </li>
        <li>
          Practice distinguishing between question forms and connecting
          phrases to accurately handle subject-verb inversion in the Structure
          section of the TOEFL test.
        </li>
        <li>
          Refer to examples and sentence patterns to reinforce your

    </div>
    <div id="skill-16" class="section-content">
      <ul>
        <li>
          After place expressions, the subject and verb may be inverted in
          English. This occurs with expressions like <em>here</em>,
          <em>there</em>, or <em>nowhere</em> (e.g., "Here is the book that
          you lent me").
        </li>
        <li>
          Inversion happens when the place expression is necessary to complete
          the meaning of the sentence (e.g., "Beyond the mountains
          <em>lies</em> the town where you will live").
        </li>
        <li>
          Prepositional phrases of place at the beginning of a sentence can
          also cause subject-verb inversion (e.g., "In the closet
          <em>are</em> the clothes that you want").
        </li>
        <li>
          If the place expression is not essential for the sentence’s meaning,
          inversion is not required (e.g., "In the forest I walked for many
          hours").
        </li>
        <li>
          Pay close attention to the placement and role of the place
          expression to determine whether inversion is necessary.
        </li>
        <li>
          Practice with sentences containing place expressions to identify
          when subject-verb inversion applies in the Structure section of the
          TOEFL test.
        </li>
        <li>
          Remember that inversion is primarily used for stylistic purposes and
          grammatical clarity in certain sentence structures.

    <div id="skill-17" class="section-content">
      <ul>
        <li>
          Subject-verb inversion occurs after certain negative expressions
          placed at the beginning of a sentence, such as <em>not</em>,
          <em>never</em>, or <em>no</em> (e.g., "Never has Mr. Jones taken a
          vacation").
        </li>
        <li>
          Negative expressions like <em>hardly</em>, <em>barely</em>,
          <em>scarcely</em>, and <em>only</em> also trigger inversion when
          they start a sentence (e.g., "Hardly ever does he take time off").
        </li>
        <li>
          The subject and verb are inverted when negative phrases like
          <em>neither</em> or <em>nor</em> appear in the middle of a sentence
          (e.g., "I do not want to go, and neither does Tom").
        </li>
        <li>
          Ensure that the verb form matches the subject and aligns with the
          tense when applying inversion.
        </li>
        <li>
          Inversion after negatives adds emphasis and is a common feature in
          formal or academic English.
        </li>
        <li>
          Practice identifying negative expressions that require inversion and

    <div id="skill-18" class="section-content">
      <ul>
        <li>
          In conditional sentences, subject-verb inversion can occur when the
          conditional clause begins with <em>had</em>, <em>should</em>, or
          <em>were</em>, and the word <em>if</em> is omitted.
        </li>
        <li>
          For example, "If he had taken more time, the results would have been
          better" can be written as "Had he taken more time, the results would
          have been better."
        </li>
        <li>
          When <em>if</em> is omitted, the subject and verb must be inverted
          to maintain correct conditional sentence structure (e.g., "Should
          you arrive before 6:00, just give me a call").
        </li>
        <li>
          Use inversion only in formal or academic contexts and ensure that
          the clause is grammatically complete and clear.
        </li>
        <li>
          Be careful not to invert the subject and verb when <em>if</em> is
          included, as this would create a grammatical error.
        </li>
        <li>
          Practice recognizing conditions where inversion is appropriate and

          Comparisons with <em>than</em> may be followed by a complete clause
