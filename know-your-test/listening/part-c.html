    <p>
      The Listening Comprehension Part C of the TOEFL test includes three
      talks, each accompanied by several questions. The talks and questions
      are presented through a recording and are not included in the test book.
      Test-takers are required to pick the correct answer from four options
      provided in the test book. Similar to the conversations in Listening
      Part B, the topics typically revolve around aspects of school life or
      current news. Additionally, the talks often consist of condensed
      versions of lectures from American college or university courses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Below are some strategies to help you handle the Listening Part C
      questions in the TOEFL exam:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Preview answers when possible. If time allows, review the answer
        choices for Listening Part C to predict:
        <p>- The topics likely to be discussed.</p>
        <p>- The questions corresponding to each group of answers.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        Focus on the first sentence of the talk. This usually provides the
        main idea, subject, or topic, which is often asked about in the
        questions.
      </li>
      <li>
        Analyze the context of the talk. Pay attention to who is speaking, the
        time and place of the discussion, and the possible academic course
        related to the lecture. These details often form the basis of
        inference questions.
      </li>
      <li>
        Match details in the talk to answer options in the test book. Follow
        along with the recording and identify correct answers as details are
        often presented in sequence and closely match the recording.
      </li>
      <li>
        Guess if unsure. Avoid leaving any answers blank, even if you're
        uncertain.
      </li>
      <li>
        Plan ahead during spare time. Use any leftover time to prepare for the
        upcoming questions.
      </li>
    </ul>

            Review the answer options in the test booklet to make an educated

            Improving your ability to answer questions in Listening Part C
            involves anticipating the types of questions you may encounter.

        <ul>
          <li>
            In Listening Part C, focus on identifying the topic or main idea
            of the talk as it is often introduced in the first sentence.
          </li>
          <li>
            Pay close attention to the initial part of the talk, as it
            typically contains a topic sentence that sets the context for the
            entire discussion.
          </li>
          <li>
            Use clues from the beginning of the talk to determine what the
            speaker will primarily discuss.

            While listening to talks in Part C, try to visualize the situation
            by asking key questions like who is speaking and when or where the
            talk takes place.
          </li>
          <li>
            Consider the subject of the talk, such as the topic or event being
            discussed, and the source of the information provided.
          </li>
          <li>
            Using these clues helps in understanding the broader context and
            answering questions more effectively.

            In Listening Part C, you can either focus solely on the talk or
            follow along with the answer choices while listening.
          </li>
          <li>
            Since detail questions are answered in order during the recording,
            reading the answer options as you listen can help identify the
