      In Part A of the Listening section, you will hear a brief exchange
      between two speakers and then a question. Usually (though not always),
      the information you need to answer that question is found in the second
      speaker’s response.

    <div id="skill-1" class="section-content">
      <ul>

          The second speaker’s statement often provides the correct answer to
          the question.
        </li>
        <li>
          Pay attention to the first speaker. If you do not catch every
          detail, do not worry; it rarely holds the key to the answer.
        </li>
        <li>
          Focus on the second speaker’s line carefully. Mentally replay it as
          you review the possible answers.

        <li>
          If one of the answer choices has words that mean the same (or almost
          the same) as those highlighted terms, it is likely the correct
          choice.

    </div>
    <div id="skill-3" class="section-content">
      <ul>
        <li>
          Often the incorrect answers in Listening Part A are answers that
          contain words with similar sounds but very different meanings from
          what you hear in the recording program. You should definitely avoid
          these answers.
        </li>
        <li>
          A key strategy is to identify important words in the second
          speaker’s line, then watch out for answer choices that include
          similarly sounding words.
        </li>
        <li>
          Words that share similar sounds with the key words from the
          conversation are frequently found in trap answers. So if an answer
          choice sounds almost the same but means something different, it is
          likely incorrect.

      <ul>
        <li>
          In some questions in Part A of the Listening section, the answer is
          not stated directly. Instead, you must draw a conclusion based on
          clues in the conversation.
        </li>
        <li>
          One type of conclusion question asks you to determine
          <em>who</em> the speaker is, using context clues or specific
          details. Look for hints like job titles, references to roles, or
          tasks the speaker performs.
        </li>
        <li>
          Another type of conclusion question asks what will
          <em>probably happen next</em>, based on the conversation’s final
          details. Think about the logical next step or action in real-life
          situations (e.g., checking out a book at a library, making an
          appointment, etc.).

      <ul>
        <li>
          Sometimes the speaker uses an <em>active</em> statement, but the
          test question or correct answer appears in a <em>passive</em> form
          (or vice versa). Make sure you determine <strong>who</strong> or
          <strong>what</strong> is performing the action in these statements.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you hear a passive statement (e.g., “A new account was opened”),
          be prepared for the correct answer to use an active statement (e.g.,
          “She opened a new account”) or the other way around.
        </li>
        <li>
          Carefully note whether the subject is the one who performs the
          action, or if the action is done to the subject. This will guide you
          to the right answer in questions involving passives.

      <div class="note">

          When a sentence contains multiple nouns, the test options often mix
          up who does what. Pay attention to the specific roles each noun
          plays.
        </li>
        <li>
          Look for clues about who is performing the action and who is
          receiving or affected by the action.
        </li>
        <li>
          Confirm that you know which person or thing has been replaced,
          removed, or involved in the action. Failing to identify this
          accurately can lead to a wrong answer.

      </ul>
      <div class="note">
        <p>
          <em>Note:</em> If two people or objects are mentioned, check

      <strong>Skill 7</strong> - LISTEN FOR NEGATIVE EXPRESSIONS
    </div>
    <div id="skill-7" class="section-content">
      <ul>
        <li>
          Negative expressions are very common in Listening Part A. They can
          include words such as <em>not</em>, <em>no</em>, <em>never</em>,
          <em>nobody</em>, <em>none</em>, or negative prefixes like
          <em>un-</em>, <em>in-</em>, <em>dis-</em> that alter the meaning of
          a statement.
        </li>
        <li>
          Often, the correct response to a negative statement is a positive
          statement containing a word with the opposite meaning. For example,
          if someone <em>did not drive slowly</em>, that implies they drove
          <em>quickly</em>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Watch out for the use of “double negatives.” Even a short exchange
          might include a statement or answer with more than one negative
          word, changing the overall meaning.
        </li>
        <li>
          Identifying the negative expression and recognizing the implied
          opposite meaning will help you eliminate wrong answers and choose
          the correct one.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <div class="note">
        <p>
          <em>Note:</em> When you hear a negative word, ask yourself what the
          logical positive counterpart would be. This often leads directly to
          the right answer in Part A.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="prep-tip-header" onclick="toggleSection('skill-8')">
      <strong>Skill 8</strong> - LISTEN FOR DOUBLE NEGATIVE EXPRESSIONS
    </div>
    <div id="skill-8" class="section-content">
      <ul>
        <li>
          Sometimes, two negative ideas appear in the same sentence, creating
          confusion about the meaning. For example, if it
          <em>isn’t impossible</em> for something to happen, this actually
          means it <em>is</em> possible.
        </li>
        <li>
          Look out for phrases that combine a negative word (<em>not</em>,
          <em>no</em>, <em>none</em>) with a negative prefix (<em>in-</em>,
          <em>un-</em>, <em>dis-</em>) or another negative verb in the same
          statement (e.g., <em>isn’t</em> + <em>aren’t</em>).
        </li>
        <li>
          “Neither … nor …” or “not … either” can also introduce double
          negatives, clarifying that both subjects are negated.
        </li>
        <li>
          Recognizing these double negatives is key to understanding the
          intended (often positive) meaning behind them.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <div class="note">
        <p>
          <em>Note:</em> When you hear more than one negative in a single
          statement, rewrite it in your mind without the negatives to see if
          it implies a positive or more neutral meaning.

    </div>
    <div id="skill-9" class="section-content">
      <ul>
        <li>
          Certain expressions in English have “almost negative” meanings.
          Examples include
          <em>hardly</em>, <em>barely</em>, <em>scarcely</em>,
          <em>rarely</em>, <em>seldom</em>, and <em>only</em>. These suggest
          that something is close to “none” or “never,” but not quite.
        </li>
        <li>
          When you hear an “almost negative” expression (e.g., “I had barely
          enough money”), realize it indicates a very small amount or a very
          low frequency—enough to accomplish something, but only just.
        </li>
        <li>
          In many Listening Part A questions, the speaker’s “almost negative”
          statement often implies a positive outcome, but with minimal
          margins. For instance, “I had barely enough money” indicates that
          they paid the bill, but had almost nothing left.
        </li>
        <li>
          Recognizing these “almost negative” words will help you choose the
          answer that reflects a small quantity or a low frequency, rather
          than a full negative or a complete positive.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <div class="note">
        <p>
          <em>Note:</em> Pay attention to the speaker’s tone and the rest of
          the sentence to understand if “barely” or “hardly” suggests an
          action was ultimately successful or not.

    <div id="skill-10" class="section-content">
      <ul>
        <li>
          Negatives used together with comparatives (e.g., “no one is more
          intelligent than she is”) often imply a superlative, or very strong
          meaning (in this example, “she is the most intelligent”).
        </li>
        <li>
          Watch out for phrases like “couldn’t be happier,” which means
          “extremely happy,” or “no one is <em>more</em> [adjective],”
          implying “the most” [adjective].
        </li>
        <li>
          When you hear a negative plus a comparative form, ask yourself if
          the statement implies the speaker is at the highest or lowest degree
          of something.

      </ul>
      <div class="note">
        <p>
          <em>Note:</em> Negative + comparative can function as a shortcut for

      <ul>
        <li>
          Expressions of agreement show that one speaker shares another
          speaker’s opinion or feeling. Sometimes these expressions confirm a
          <strong>positive statement</strong> (e.g., “So do I,” “Me too”),
          while others confirm a <strong>negative statement</strong> (e.g.,
          “Neither do I,” “I don’t either”).
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>So do I</em> or <em>Me too</em> indicates agreement with a
          positive statement, such as “I believe the hypothesis is correct.”
          “So do I” means “I also believe that.”
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>Neither do I</em> or <em>I don’t either</em> indicates agreement
          with a negative statement, such as “I don’t think our teacher is
          very interesting.” “Neither do I” means “I also don’t think that.”
        </li>
        <li>
          Listen carefully for these short agreement phrases. They often
          appear at the end of a speaker’s turn and can directly lead you to
          the correct answer choice.

      </ul>
      <div class="note">

          <strong>Expressions of Uncertainty</strong> often involve words or
          phrases like <em>might</em>, <em>could</em>, <em>I’m not sure</em>,
          <em>maybe</em>, <em>perhaps</em>, or tag questions (e.g., “isn’t

          hesitant or uncertain one.
        </li>
        <li>
          When you hear these uncertainty cues, look for an answer choice that

    <div id="skill-13" class="section-content">
      <ul>
        <li>
          Emphatic expressions of surprise occur when a speaker uses a form of
          <em>do</em>, <em>did</em>, <em>does</em>, <em>is</em>, <em>has</em>,
          etc. with extra stress in order to emphasize they are surprised by
          something.
          <br />
          Example:
          <strong>Then, he <em>did</em> get a new car!</strong> (implies the
          speaker thought he wouldn’t get one).
        </li>
        <li>
          These emphatic forms often show that the speaker expected the
          opposite outcome or had previously believed something else to be
          true.
        </li>
        <li>
          Look out for a sudden shift in tone when words like “do,” “did,”

          surprise and contradict an earlier assumption.
        </li>
        <li>
          Common emphatic patterns include:

            <li>
              <strong>Then, she <em>did</em> read it!</strong> → “I thought

        <p>
          <em>Note:</em> When you hear an emphatic verb form in Listening Part

          this new understanding (e.g., “He actually did it”).

    <div id="skill-14" class="section-content">
      <ul>
        <li>
          Conversations about wishes can appear in Listening Part A. The key
          point to remember is that a wish often implies the
          <strong>opposite</strong> of the stated wish is true. For example,
          “I wish I could go” usually means “I cannot go.”
        </li>
        <li>
          When you hear someone use “wish” in the present tense (e.g., “I wish
          I had more time”), it indicates a desire about the present
          situation, which is not true now (meaning they don’t actually have
          more time).
        </li>
        <li>
          If the speaker uses a past tense form (e.g., “I wish I were at
          home”), it implies a contrary present reality (the speaker is not at
          home).
        </li>
        <li>
          If the speaker uses a past perfect form (e.g., “I wish I had been
          there”), it implies a contrary past reality (the speaker was not
          there in the past).
        </li>
        <li>
          Identifying what the speaker <em>wishes</em> and converting it to
          the actual situation (the opposite of the wish) will lead you to the
          best answer choice.

      </ul>
      <div class="note">
        <p>
          <em>Note:</em> Always ask yourself what the speaker’s wish tells you
          about the present or past situation. The correct answer often states
          that opposite reality.

          Conversations containing conditional statements (e.g., “If I had
          time…”) can appear in Listening Part A. The key idea is that the
          <strong>condition implies the opposite is true</strong>. For
          example, “If I had time, I would go,” means “I do <em>not</em>
          have time, so I cannot go.”
        </li>
        <li>
          An affirmative condition (e.g., “If she were at home, she could do
          it”) implies a negative reality (she is not at home).
        </li>
        <li>
          A negative condition (e.g., “If she weren’t at home, she could do
          it”) implies an affirmative reality (she is at home).
        </li>
        <li>
          A past tense conditional (e.g., “If I had money, I would buy it”)
          indicates a present reality that is untrue (I do not have money).
        </li>
        <li>
          A past perfect conditional (e.g., “If I had had money, I would have
          bought it”) implies a past reality that did not occur (I did not
          have money, so I didn’t buy it).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <div class="note">
        <p>
          <em>Note:</em> When you hear an untrue condition, be sure to convert
          it in your mind to its real meaning (the opposite). This helps you
          find the answer choice that reflects the actual situation.

    <div id="skill-16" class="section-content">
      <ul>
        <li>
          Two- and three-part verbs consist of a verb plus one or more
          particles (e.g.,
          <em>call off</em>, <em>look over</em>, <em>put up with</em>). The
          addition of these particles can drastically change the verb’s
          meaning in an idiomatic way.
        </li>
        <li>
          When you hear a multi-part verb in Listening Part A, be sure to
          identify the entire phrase, not just the main verb. For example,
          <em>call off</em> does not mean “to phone” but “to cancel,” whereas
          <em>call up</em> can mean “to phone someone.”
        </li>
        <li>
          If an answer choice only accounts for the base verb (ignoring the
          particle) and changes the meaning, it is probably a trap. Make sure
          the entire phrasal verb matches the conversation’s meaning.
        </li>
        <li>
          Common two-part verbs: <em>take off</em>, <em>put on</em>,
          <em>look up</em>, <em>turn down</em>, <em>call off</em>. Common
          three-part verbs: <em>look forward to</em>, <em>put up with</em>,
          <em>look down on</em>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <div class="note">
        <p>
          <em>Note:</em> Practice identifying phrasal verbs as a single unit
          of meaning. This will help you determine which answer choice
          correctly reflects the speaker’s intent.

    </div>
    <div id="skill-17" class="section-content">
      <ul>
        <li>
          Idioms are special expressions in English that convey meanings
          beyond the literal definitions of their individual words (e.g.,
          “burning the candle at both ends” means “doing too much”).
        </li>
        <li>
          In Listening Part A, questions involving idioms can be tricky
          because they may describe one situation literally, yet actually
          refer to a different situation entirely.
        </li>
        <li>
          Pay attention to context. The way speakers use idioms often reveals
          the figurative meaning rather than the literal one.
        </li>
        <li>
          If an answer choice interprets the idiom literally (e.g., talking
          about an actual candle), it is usually incorrect. Look instead for
          the figurative meaning (e.g., working too hard, taking on too many
          responsibilities).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <div class="note">
        <p>
          <em>Note:</em> Common idioms include “hit the sack” (go to bed),
          “pull someone’s leg” (joking), and “give someone a hand” (help
          someone). Recognizing these helps avoid literal misunderstandings.
