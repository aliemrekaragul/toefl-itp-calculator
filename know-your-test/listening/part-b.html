      In the Listening Comprehension section of the TOEFL test, Part B
      involves two extended dialogues. Each dialogue is followed by several
      questions. You will listen to both the conversations and the questions;
      they do not appear in your test booklet. Your task is to select the
      correct answer for each question from four available choices, which you
      will find printed in your test booklet. Typically, the dialogues deal
      with topics related to student life, such as the challenges of certain
      classes, steps for writing a research paper, or the process of
      registering for a course. Sometimes, they focus on issues making
      headlines in the United States—for example, water supply desalination,
      ways to recycle products, or damage caused by storms or other natural
      events.
    </p>
    <p>
      Below are some strategies to help you handle the Listening Part B
      questions in the TOEFL exam:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Preview the questions and answers if possible. When you glance at the
        answer choices in advance, try to predict both the potential topics of
        the conversations and the questions that might appear.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pay close attention to the opening line of each conversation. It
        usually presents the main theme, subject matter, or discussion topic.
        The test often includes questions about this initial information.
      </li>
      <li>
        Identify the context of the conversation as you listen. Figure out who
        is speaking, where the dialogue is taking place, and when it occurs.
        Expect questions asking you to infer these details.
      </li>
      <li>
        Follow along in your test book and select the correct answers as the
        conversation unfolds. Typically, questions about specific details are
        addressed in chronological order, and the correct choice often
        reflects language closely matching that in the audio.
      </li>
      <li>
        Make an educated guess if you’re uncertain. Never leave an answer
        blank.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use any remaining time to review upcoming questions and their answer
        choices so you can continue anticipating what you’ll hear next.
      </li>
    </ul>

            While listening to each conversation in Listening Part B, try to

          <li>
            Identify when and where the conversation is likely taking place
            based on contextual clues.

        <ul>
          <li>
            Use one of two approaches: either listen carefully to the
            conversation and ignore the answers, or follow along with the
            answers in the test book as you listen.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you prefer to focus only on the conversation, do so to avoid
            distractions. Alternatively, some find it easier to match details
            with answer choices as they listen.
          </li>
          <li>
            Since detail questions are typically answered in the same order
            they are presented in the conversation, this method allows you to
            identify correct answers as you progress through the recording.
