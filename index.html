          I work for an institution whose final exam is a TOEFL ITP. My
          students always ask me what my judgment is about whether they will
          get a high score on TOEFL ITP test. They even throw some numbers,
          counts of correct items, randomly and ask if those numbers would be
          enough for them to get a target score. Well, let me state without
          messing: nobody can know. Not even ETS. But we can predict very
          accurately. And if you are just interested in your score prediction,
          use our calculator tool below. It will give you an estimate.

          TOEFL ITP is a unique exam in that it is developed by Educational
          Testing Service (ETS) but applied by institutions. It ensures a
          standardized construct of the test. However, ensuring a standard
          test environment is highly dependent on the institution itself. ETS,
          of course, has regulations and standards for this too. But even a
          minor change in the testing environment of a paper based test such
          as the height of the desks, the width of the testing room, or the
          location of the building etc. might effect the test results. Those
          effects might be positive or negative and very difficult to detect.
          That's why TOEFL ITP scores are not calculated with predetermined
          weightings. For example, we cannot say one correct listening answer
          is 1.2 points of your total score.
        </p>

          Instead of using standard weights, ETS scores each test session
          separately. In other words, whenever a test session occurs in an
          institution, it is considered to be a unique test by itself. Even if
          the same items and booklets were used during another session, their
          scoring would be different from each other. So, the group of
          individuals taking the test in a session has an immense effect on
          how the scores are calculated.
        </p>
        <h2>How are the scores calculated?</h2>
        <p>
          To answer this question, I have to talk technically a little. No
          worries, I will be shallow as much as I can: Statistically and
          hypothetically speaking, if a group of individuals is crowded enough
          to represent the population it belongs to, both the group's and
          population's score distribution would look the same. We call this
          the normal distribution, believed to be brought up by Carl Frederich
          Gauss. That's why it is also called the Gaussian Distribution.
        </p>
        <img src="itp-banner-0.png" alt="itp" style="margin: 10px ; width: 100%;">
        <p>
          What does this have to do with TOEFL ITP? Well, the Gaussian
          Distribution gives us an advantage. We can scale the scores of a
          group on the same level of the population. Actually, there are even
          standardized scales for that such as the z-scores and t-scores. So,
          basically if separate groups in different sessions are normally
          distributed, we can statistically place all these groups on the same
          scale and get comparable scores. In TOEFL ITP, that's how they
          manage to obtain standard scores from different test sessions. They
          just check if the raw scores of the group in the session is normally
          distributed. If so, the scores are simply converted to t-scores.
          Then, to make it more comprehensible, they just multiply the
          standardized scores of individuals with 10. That's how your TOEFL
          ITP score is calculated. And if the group is not normally
          distributed, which is a very rare case if there are enough number of
          students, then there are some other standardization techniques that
          can be utilized.

        <p>
          Why am I telling you all about this? Actually, my motive is to
          convince you that in TOEFL ITP we cannot calculate your exact scores
          prior to taking the test with the group in the session. We can just
          use conversion tables and make strong guesses. This tool is also
          doing the same. So, the scores here are not exactly accurate, but
          they are highly plausible predictions.
