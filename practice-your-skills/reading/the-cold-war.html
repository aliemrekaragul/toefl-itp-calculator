        <h2>Reading Text 2 - The Cold War</h2>
        <div id="reading-text">
            <p>The Cold War was a period of political and military tension between the United States and the Soviet
                Union, along with their respective allies, following World War II. It lasted from the late 1940s until
                the early 1990s. Despite the term "war," there was no direct large-scale fighting between the two
                superpowers. Instead, they engaged in a competition for influence and power around the world.</p>
            <p>One key feature of the Cold War was the arms race. Both the United States and the Soviet Union built up
                large stockpiles of nuclear weapons. This created a situation called "mutual assured destruction," where
                neither side could attack the other without risking total destruction of both countries. This threat of
                nuclear war made the Cold War a tense and dangerous time.</p>
            <p>Another aspect of the Cold War was the space race. The two superpowers competed to achieve major
                milestones in space exploration. In 1957, the Soviet Union launched Sputnik, the first artificial
                satellite to orbit the Earth. Later, in 1969, the United States landed the first humans on the moon with
                the Apollo 11 mission. These achievements were not just about science; they were also about showing
                which system—capitalism or communism—was superior.</p>
            <p>The Cold War also affected many other countries. The United States and the Soviet Union supported
                opposing sides in conflicts around the world. For example, during the Korean War (1950–1953) and the
                Vietnam War (1955–1975), each superpower backed different governments and armies. These "proxy wars"
                caused great suffering and loss of life in the countries where they took place.</p>
            <p>The Cold War finally ended in the early 1990s. The Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, marking the end of
                communist rule in Eastern Europe. This event brought the long period of global tension to a close.
                Today, the Cold War remains an important part of history, reminding the world of the dangers of
                political and military rivalries.</p>
