        <h2>Reading Text 4 - The Tomb of Antipope John XXIII</h2>
        <div id="reading-text">
            <p>The Tomb of Antipope John XXIII is located in Florence, Italy, inside the famous Baptistery of St. John.
                This tomb is a remarkable example of Renaissance art and architecture. It was created by two renowned
                artists, Donatello and Michelozzo, in the early 15th century. The tomb is considered a masterpiece
                because of its intricate design and use of bronze, marble, and other materials.</p>
            <p>John XXIII, whose real name was Baldassarre Cossa, was an antipope during the 15th century. An antipope
                is a person who claims to be the pope without being officially recognized by the Catholic Church.
                Baldassarre Cossa was elected as an antipope during a time when the Catholic Church was divided by a
                conflict called the Western Schism. This period lasted from 1378 to 1417, when different people claimed
                to be the true pope. After losing power, John XXIII sought refuge in Florence, where he died in 1419.
            </p>
            <p>The tomb was commissioned by Giovanni di Bicci de' Medici, an important figure in Florence's history and
                the founder of the powerful Medici family. The Medici family was known for their support of the arts,
                and this tomb reflects their influence on Renaissance culture.</p>
            <p>The tomb’s design is striking. It includes a bronze statue of John XXIII dressed in papal robes, even
                though he was not a legitimate pope. The tomb also features beautiful relief sculptures and symbols of
                power, such as eagles and lions. These details demonstrate the skill of the artists and the importance
                of the person buried there.</p>
            <p>Today, the Tomb of Antipope John XXIII is admired by visitors from all over the world. It serves as both
                a work of art and a reminder of a unique moment in history.</p>
