        <h2>Reading Text 1 - Savanna Life</h2>
        <div id="reading-text">
            <p>The savanna is a type of grassland ecosystem found in regions where there is not enough rainfall to
                support a forest but more rainfall than a desert. Savannas are located mainly in Africa, South America,
                India, and Australia. These vast, open landscapes are home to a wide variety of plants and animals.</p>
            <p>The African savanna, for example, is famous for its remarkable wildlife. Many iconic animals such as
                lions, elephants, giraffes, and zebras live there. These animals are well-adapted to life in this
                environment. For instance, elephants use their large ears to cool themselves, while lions rest during
                the heat of the day and hunt at night. Animals in the savanna often travel in herds or packs for safety
                and to find food and water.</p>
            <p>Plants in the savanna must also adapt to the environment. The most common type of vegetation is grass,
                but there are also scattered trees, such as acacias and baobabs. These trees are drought-resistant,
                meaning they can survive long periods without water. For example, the baobab tree stores water in its
                thick trunk to stay alive during the dry season. Fires are also common in savannas and help keep the
                ecosystem healthy by clearing dead plants and encouraging new growth.</p>
            <p>Life in the savanna depends on seasonal changes. There are usually two main seasons: a wet season and a
                dry season. During the wet season, heavy rains cause rivers and lakes to fill, and plants grow quickly.
                The dry season, on the other hand, brings very little rain, making water and food harder to find. To
                survive, many animals migrate, traveling great distances to follow the rains and find food.</p>
            <p>The savanna is not only important for wildlife but also for people. Many communities in Africa, for
                example, depend on the savanna for grazing cattle and growing crops. However, human activities, such as
                farming, deforestation, and hunting, are putting pressure on this delicate ecosystem. Conservation
                efforts are now being made to protect the savanna and ensure it can sustain life for future generations.
